Being is hard (c language source)

This is a "simulation" the minimun "life" of a "sentient" "life form" (did you see the quotation marks, right?). 
It begins with a set of random characteristics such as lifespan, intelectual peak and duration of this one and the results are slightly cruel and kind of realistic... you know, life is a b*tch.
